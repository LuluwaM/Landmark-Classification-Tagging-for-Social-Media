# Landmark-Classification-Tagging-for-Social-Media

## ðŸ“Œ Project Idea
This project is part of the **Machine Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree** program.  
It aims to build a **Landmark Classifier** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize landmarks in images.  This technology helps photo storage and sharing services determine the geographic location of images without GPS metadata, enabling features like:  Organizing images by location.

# ðŸ“‹ Project Steps
1. **Create a CNN from Scratch**  
   - Explore and preprocess the dataset.  
   - Design and train a custom convolutional neural network.  

2. **Apply Transfer Learning**  
   - Select a pre-trained model.  
   - Fine-tune it on the project dataset.  

3. **Deploy the Model in an App**
