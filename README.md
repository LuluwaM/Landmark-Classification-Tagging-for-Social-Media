# Landmark-Classification-Tagging-for-Social-Media

## ðŸ“Œ Project Idea
This project is part of the **Machine Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree** program.  
It aims to build a **Landmark Classifier** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize landmarks in images.  This technology helps photo storage and sharing services determine the geographic location of images without GPS metadata, enabling features like:  Organizing images by location.
